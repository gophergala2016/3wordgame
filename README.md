# 3wordgame

## Info

You start out by saying three words which will continue onto a story line. Each post should only be three words, and they must make sense in order for them to apply. The story line will branch out into a large scale story, and the direction of the story is dependent on the person who says something after you. You can also change the story line to your own likings by posting three words of your own. 

Remember, your words must make sense in conjunction of the prior three words, though the mood does not have to be the same, nor does it need to be serious in any way.

No punctuation other than commas and periods after one of the words, not at the beginning of them. It might make the story line complicated.
